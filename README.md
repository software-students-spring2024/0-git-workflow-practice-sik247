# Summary

The article explores the importance of diversity in software engineering and suggests tapping into coding boot camps as a strategic approach to address the industry's lack of diversity. The author, Kelsey Griffis, emphasizes the benefits of sourcing talent from coding boot camps, citing an example of a professional who successfully transitioned into software development through such a program.

The challenges of diversity in software engineering, particularly the underrepresentation of women and minorities, are highlighted. The article argues that incorporating individuals from coding boot camps can bring unique perspectives, preventing unintentional biases, and enriching software teams with diverse insights.

Coding boot camps are presented as inclusive pathways due to their affordability, flexibility, and accessibility. They are seen as alternatives for individuals unable to pursue traditional four-year degrees and are particularly suitable for those juggling work or family responsibilities. The article encourages HR leaders to forge partnerships with coding boot camps, establish internship programs, mentorship opportunities, and direct hiring pipelines for graduates.

The importance of ongoing support and an inclusive organizational culture is stressed. Mentoring programs and skill development workshops are recommended to empower boot camp graduates and ensure their voices are heard and valued. The article also suggests measuring and adjusting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts by establishing clear metrics, benchmarking against industry standards, and collecting demographic data.

I think that this article starts a good discussion for anyone curious about industry-wide diversity challenges. What I appreciated was how unique perspectives from individuals from coding boot camps were highlighted as affordable pathways for learning software are needed in the industry.

<br> I found the poem a nice read as well.
