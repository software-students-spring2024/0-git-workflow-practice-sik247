# Summary

The article explores the importance of diversity in software engineering and suggests tapping into coding boot camps as a strategic approach to address the industry's lack of diversity. The author, Kelsey Griffis, emphasizes the benefits of sourcing talent from coding boot camps, citing an example of a professional who successfully transitioned into software development through such a program.

The challenges of diversity in software engineering, particularly the underrepresentation of women and minorities, are highlighted. The article argues that incorporating individuals from coding boot camps can bring unique perspectives, preventing unintentional biases, and enriching software teams with diverse insights.

Coding boot camps are presented as inclusive pathways due to their affordability, flexibility, and accessibility. They are seen as alternatives for individuals unable to pursue traditional four-year degrees and are particularly suitable for those juggling work or family responsibilities. The article encourages HR leaders to forge partnerships with coding boot camps, establish internship programs, mentorship opportunities, and direct hiring pipelines for graduates.

The importance of ongoing support and an inclusive organizational culture is stressed. Mentoring programs and skill development workshops are recommended to empower boot camp graduates and ensure their voices are heard and valued. The article also suggests measuring and adjusting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts by establishing clear metrics, benchmarking against industry standards, and collecting demographic data.





# This is my poem
In the realm where talents bloom and shine,
I stand alone in this spotlight so divine.
A humble soul, stripped bare of art,
Yet within, I hold a hopeful heart.

No dazzling strokes from a gifted hand,
No verses that effortlessly expand.
In this vast canvas, I'm but a void,
A silent actor, talents unemployed.

No silver tongue with eloquent sound,
No grandeur in the words I've found.
I linger in shadows, a barren stage,
A player reciting a talentless page.

Yet, in this emptiness, a tale does grow,
A soliloquy of a spirit's ebb and flow.
For in the absence of brilliance, I see,
A quiet strength, a resilience in me.

No grand symphony of talents to weave,
Just a whispering wind that I perceive.
In each stumble, in my faltering try,
A spirit persists, refusing to lie.

No spotlight, no applause to enthrall,
Yet in this journey, I stand tall.
For in the void, a treasure lies,
A truth that echoes, a humble rise.

So, let not the lack of talent confine,
For within it, a unique path may twine.
A soliloquy of effort, passion's call,
A testament to the beauty of embracing the fall.
